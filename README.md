# Likud-Primaries
Analysis for the Likud's 2019 Primaries based on the official polling stations datasets.  
Using correlation as a distance metric for networkx graph we were able to find "deals" between candidates.  
The analysis was done by members of a data-science WhatsApp group, mainly by Moshe Schorr.
